# Cry Boy
Still just getting started...

## Why???
This will be far from the first gameboy emulator, though it is likely to be the first one written in Crystal. Having implemented a cpu core for the chip8, I wanted to tackle something a little bigger, and for a system I personally grew up with. I was taken by Colby Swandale's attempt to write one in a more human readable language like Ruby, and wondered if Crystal might be used simultaneously deliver legible code as well as playable framerates.

## Reference material
Not going to pretend this was developed in a vacuum, and much credit goes to those who came before. The following resources have proven invaluable.
